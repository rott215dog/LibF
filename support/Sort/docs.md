# Functions: 

## bubble_sort
    - A mutating function that takes a list (L) and sorts it from least to greatest
    - Less efficient than `qsort`

### bubble_sort_count
    - A mutating function that takes a list (L), runs bubble_sort on it but returns the number of times a switch was made

## selection_sort
    - A mutating function that takes a list (L) and sorts it from least to greatest
    - Less efficient than `qsort`

### selection_sort_count
    - A mutating function that takes a list (L), runs selection_sort on it but returns the number of times a switch was made

## qsort
    - Takes a list (L), sorts its values (efficiently) from least to greatest
    - The sorted list is not a mutation, but rather a second list that is returned

## mqsort
    - A mutator that takes a list (L) and efficiently sorts it from least to greatest

### elim_dups
    - Takes a list (L) and removes duplicate values (by mutation)

### exchange
    - Takes a list (L) and two index values (a,b) and switches the objects at those indices
